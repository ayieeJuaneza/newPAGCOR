                        <p>Casino Filipino promotes responsible gaming to prevent potential harm to the individual players and the community.
                        One important component of responsible gaming is the implementation of the <span className='text-warning'>"Player Exclusion Program"</span> The program aims to provide patrons with the option of getting barred from all gaming venues or sites once they feel that they themselves or their relatives are developing a problem with gambling.</p>

                        <div>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Know the games.</li>
                                <p>Refrain from wagering before you understand how a game is played and the odds of winning. Feel free to ask casino staff about game rules and chances.</p>
                                <li>Plan your activity.</li>
                                <p>There are alternative pastimes that can be just as relaxing or as enjoyable as gambling. Going to the casino is just one among many leisure activities.</p>
                                <li>Set a time and money limit.</li>
                                <p>Plan your playing schedule with a definite time to stand up and leave. Why not set an alarm to remind you? You can also arrange for someone to pick you up after an hour or two.</p>
                                <li>Be conscious of yourself.</li>
                                <p>Start your play in a relaxed state and with a clear mind. Don't be rash. While playing, quick decisions made under stress or in moments of high emotion can be harmful.</p>
                                <li>Keep a healthy social mindset.</li>
                                <p>Don't take the games too seriously. Being more open and friendly to people you play with makes gaming more fun and exciting.</p>
