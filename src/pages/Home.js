          </h1>
          <p>Fraudsters are taking advantage of social media and the uncertainties brought by the COVID19 Pandemic to scam your money, steal your financial information, and use your identity for illegal purposes.The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) has received information that certain persons have been organizing illegal Bingo games and internet/ online gambling and using Facebook to promote such illegal activities. The public is warned not to patronize such schemes due to the risk of being scammed, identity theft, and credit card fraud. Betting on such illegal gambling activities is also a crime. PAGCOR is responsible for licensing and regulating persons primarily engaged in gambling and their allied businesses. No person other than those licensed by PAGCOR and other Government agencies may operate gambling in the Philippines.

(PD1602 in relation to RA10175, see also EO13 s. 2017).
